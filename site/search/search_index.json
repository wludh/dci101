Whether it's for work, school, volunteering, organizing, art, or just for fun, there are plenty of ways to carve out your own corner of the Web. Social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook are ubiquitous now, but it used to be that if you wanted to appear in search results, you had to create your own website. If you are a student or navigating the professional world, chances are that 1) someone out there might Google you and 2) you want them to see accurate information and work that you're proud of. A professional website can be a simple single page with limited information, or it can contain your whole life. Chances are, at some point you've relied on information from a personal website. Maybe you found an article you need for a bibliography, a snippet of code that had been giving you trouble, or even an email address for someone who has lost their wallet.</p> <p>If you're conducting research in a field, making art, or selling products, there are others who will be interested in the work you're doing. Check out the sites of others in your intended field of study or career path to see what their websites look like. Some scholars share articles they've written, code libraries, data they've gathered, or new methods they're experimenting with. In the library and digital scholarship world, open and public scholarship is highly valued. Many of the links in this website go to the websites of DH-ers who have been generous enough to share a tutorial or write up their thoughts on a particular method.</p> <p>Whether you create a professional portfolio or not, there is a lot to be said for the form of a website. Most of the scholarship we read, not to mention everything else, has been designed and formatted to be consumed on the Web. Presenting your own work in that format gives you experience with seemingly silly things like getting your images to float nicely with your text or finding a place to reliably store your data.

You want to get a sense of what is out there already about this topic. You want to find resources that might help with the context, but you also want to see what kind of work has already been done. Save yourself the frustration of getting halfway through a data collection project before you realize that someone has already done this work before. Getting a sense of existing approaches might also help steer you toward your approach. What do similar projects lack? How can you fill in the gaps? </p> <p>Some of you may already be flying through the internet, opening up tab after tab, making notes. But you might also find this part of the process to be paralyzing. It's a wide open world out there. Here are some tips to help you structure this important piece: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Structure your research process into phases. Gathering, analyzing, refining, etc. Give yourself time to explore, without deciding whether or not an article, a tutorial, a website is useful or not. You're just trying familiarize yourself with what is out there. You can use a document or something like ZOtero to help. </p> </li> <li> <p>Once you've done your gathering, then spend some time actually reading and considering what you've found. It is useful? Does it help you think about your topic in a new way? Did the title seem great but the content was lacking? Does an article give you a new path to explore? Try to sit with what you've found and think about it before moving on. </p> </li> <li> <p>Once you have a solid sense of what is out there about your topic, it's time to refine and narrow your scope. This stage has its own challenges. It can be hard to make a decision at this stage. You feel pressure to make the right one. Don't worry, you can still pivot if you need to, but remember that there are benefits to making decisions and moving ahead now. You're probably on a deadline and need to get moving onto the next phase of the project. Consider creating a mental or physical \"parking lot\" for ideas or resources that you are intrigued by, but don't have time for right now. </p> </li> <li> <p>You may notice that these tips are conflating the idea of your topic and the research about your topic. That's because at this stage, things are still rather fluid. You may discover that the object, question, or skill that was going to be your topic is just not tenable at this time. Or you may be researching the historical background for one thing and come across an amazing data set for another thing that changes your direction. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Enough pep talk! Give me some real tips: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Start at the library. Whether it's your library's website or the physical location, browse the resources that your institution has provided for you. Talk to a librarian you know, they love to help. </p> </li> <li> <p>Start local. Every town has its stories. Archives, museums, historical societies, and special collections can hold original or unique materials about the people and places nearby. In this coursebook, we've worked with data about the inhabitants of the local cemetery and the school newspaper. These local stories may not have been analyzed or shared before, but they still have relevance to larger issues. Not all small institutions have the resources to make their holdings available online, so you may have to talk to someone or get creative.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the discipline. Don't forget that scholarly work segments itself by discipline, so you may have to navigate those boundaries. Is your topic fundamentally about literature? About history? About philosophy? What other disciplines does it touch? Check out the scholarly organization for that discipline, its major journals, or research centers.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"process/#whats-my-project","title":"What's my project?","text":"<p>Hopefully, if you've read other sections of this coursebook, you have an idea of what humanities data could look like.

Here, let's cover it as part of the research and project process. Chances are, data modeling will go hand in hand with determining your specific research questions. You will need to iterate over this process a few times before you've arrived at something feasible. </p> <ol> <li>What is one potential research question that you can think of? Pay attention to how you begin your question. Are you asking how many? Who? What? </li> <li>How would you answer that question with some kind of data? It can be an unproven, hypothetical answer, but you should think through what kind of answers you're looking for. </li> <li>Now swim around in your answer a little bit. What is your answer made of? Do you need to count something to get to that answer? What do you need to count? Are you tracking something over time, and therefore need time-based data? Are you looking at relationships, so you need information about people? </li> <li>Make a list of all the pieces of information you might need to answer your question. This could be the beginning of your data model.</li> <li>Go through these steps again with a different question and potential answer. How do your data needs compare?

Hopefully by working through those questions, you should have an idea of where you're headed. Again, it's totally normal to adjust or go through this cycle again. You may even get to the point of visualization and realize you need to regroup. For now, let's assume you're ready to start putting together your data. You have some options.</p>"},{"location":"process/#creating-data","title":"Creating data","text":"<p>You may determine that you need to create your data set from scratch. What does \"from scratch\" mean? Are eggs involved? Chances are you are not going to be pulling data magically from your brain. It's more likely that you will have a source or multiple sources that need to be transformed in a structured data set that can be analyzed by a piece of software. The draft data model you created will guide you in this process. </p> <p>Many humanities data projects begin with the kind of old books that seem to be forgotten about on library shelves. Scholars of past centuries did a lot of data-driven work, they just put all their data into a print book, and now that information needs to be transformed. For example, The Ancient Graffiti Project relies on a 19th century collection of inscriptions gathered into set of large, heavy volumes known as Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. Mapping the Scottish Reformation is a prosopography project that gathers data about Scottish ministers from a text known as the Fasti. While the author of the Fasti, Hew Scott, did tremendous work in compiling this text, he was loose with the facts and didn't cite his sources. In the end, both of these projects will provide a database and visualizations for users to ask their own research questions. But the process of getting there involves careful data entry and cross-referencing. The project team is not necessarily transcribing texts from beginning to end, they are extracting each data point in a way that fits their data model. They might not extract every piece of information, instead, they're letting their project goals guide them. Rest assured, both of these projects added to and refined their data model over time. </p> <p>If you have generated some research questions and drafted a data model, go ahead and open up a new spreadsheet. Label some fields, start filling in data, then step back and review your work. Does your source include information you forgot to put in your data model? Do these fields make sense to another person? Do you need another spreadsheet? On the flip side, are you trying to gather too much data? Do you need every single detail? </p> <p>If you're not sure how to answer these questions, why not skip ahead to visualization or analysis? Test out the data you've gathered so far, even if it's not complete, just to see how it performs. Again, this iterative approach is key to creating a workable project. </p>"},{"location":"process/#finding-data","title":"Finding data","text":"<p>You may determine that your project or your constraints require that you find existing data sources. That's great! You're reusing existing information in new ways! But it can be a struggle to find the exact data set you're looking for. There is not one single catalog of data that you can use to find what you're looking for. You may have to combine pieces of multiple data sets. Alternatively, you may not have access or be legally allowed to use the data you're seeking. It's another reason to identify other scholars working on similar topic, you may be able to ask advice or find guidance. </p>"},{"location":"process/#analyzing-your-data","title":"Analyzing your data","text":"<p>Okay, let's say you have put together a respectable data set that you think addresses your goals. What next? Throughout this coursebook, we have explored a range of analysis methods. Your research questions should help you determine the method or methods that make sense. But once you start using a method or visualizing your data, how do you know when you're getting answers? Here are some things to keep in mind: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Know your material. It's up to you and your understanding of your subject to determine what matters. If you've generated a network graph, but you don't know much about the major players, you're going to struggle. Let your visualizations inspire you to dig back into research topics. </p> </li> <li> <p>Set benchmarks. Running a process once or creating one visualization isn't enough. Perform your analysis methods over and over so you have a sense of what is normal vs. extreme. You might also find errors in your data this way. If you're interested in how often the word \"love\" is used over time, you might want to try synonyms of that word. Do all words behave the same way? What are the trends over time? Is that actually a unique line on your graph? </p> </li> <li> <p>Remember your discipline. Positioning your work within a discipline is not an arbitrary decision. It gives you standards and priorities for your work. A literary scholar is going to approach a text differently than a historian. They're going to care about different questions. If you're a historian, you might be intrigued by the use of literary symbolism in a text, but know that you have to focus on the historical elements, not the style. Read the literature of the discipline and review other projects to get a sense of how their analysis works. </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"process/#case-study-spanish-gallery","title":"Case study: Spanish Gallery","text":"<p>To pull this all together, let's walk through a case study of a project from a former student, Alice. Alice is an art history major with some experience in digital methods from other classes and her work on a DH project. In one of her classes, she learns about the Spanish Gallery. The Spanish Gallery was assembled at the Louvre by King Louis Phillipe in 1838 to showcase Spanish art during a time of French occupation of Spain. After his death, the gallery was sent to auction in London and dispersed into private hands. Alice wonders what happened to these paintings after the auction, as well as their origins in Spain. She imagines what the gallery might have looked like all assembled, similar to a project she put together on Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. In reading the Wikipedia article, she notices a link to the digital copy of the gallery catalog from 1838. She recognizes these catalog as a potential source of data, especially when combined with her knowledge of searching auction records. The catalog is arranged in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief bio, then a list of the paintings and their dimensions. Alice sees that the digital book is available to download as plain text, which will make it easier to work with. She also notices that the text isn't quite perfect, so she will need to budget time for correction. Not to mention it's all in French! Finally, there appear to be annotations in pencil on the pages, so that may be something to look into. </p> <p>Alice opens Google Sheets and gets to work on this spreadsheet. The catalog has assigned each painting a number, so she uses that as an ID field. The thing that is being described in each row is the painting, with the artist, bio, size, location modifying that painting. After starting that work, she realizes that it's repetitive to include the art information multiple times, so she creates a second sheet that is just a list of the artists and their information. She cleverly uses a built-in translation feature in Google sheets to translate the French to English for the whole column, rather than doing it one by one: <code>=GOOGLETRANSLATE(B2, \"fr\", \"en\")</code>. </p> <p>Alice can't help but start researching the modern locations of these pieces of art. She finds that this work is going to be more challenging than she anticipated, so she creates another sheet to separate this work into a second phase of the project. There just aren't enough accessible records for each piece of work. Phase 1 will have to be about creating data on the gallery itself, Phase 2 will concern the auction and dispersal of the art. Similarly, finding the original locations of the art may be challenging too, since the catalog only lists where the artist was from. She knows another student who has used Google Street View and tourist websites to confirm the location of shrines in Spain. She supposes that's Phase 3! </p> <p>Alice's project is still in progress, but hopefully this example gave you an idea of how a project like this can change as it progresses. </p>"},{"location":"process/#resources","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"protocols/","title":"Protocols","text":""},{"location":"protocols/#course-protocols","title":"Course protocols","text":"<ul> <li>If you have ever labeled yourself as \u201cbad at technology,\u201d you are welcome in this course.

The following is designed to help you get started on finding sources. You should write your answers as you go - they can be messy! </p> <ol> <li> <p>Brainstorm keywords. Think about your topic. What are all the potential words that describe or relate to this topic? Start from your own brain first, then go to a search engine. You could even draw a mind map of the way terms relate or how different disciplines/industries refer to the same concept. The deeper you get into a field, the more you find that experts use specialized language to get more specific about what they're talking about. For example: as I start searching for information about algorithms, I start to see references to \"neural networks\" and \"deep learning\" algorithms. I'll add those to my list and look for definitions. </p> </li> <li> <p>Establish a baseline. Look for your topic in several search engines or database and get a sense of the initial results. I would suggest Google, Google Scholar, Wikipedia, the Library Catalog, and a news source (New York Times, Washington Post, etc.) What do you see in the top ten results? What are the issues being discussed? What types of sources are coming up (blog posts, news articles, etc)? Who are the authors? Consider searching in a private browser as well, just to see if the results are different. Make a table or a list for each search engine and summarize the results. For example: TikTok algorithm</p> </li> </ol> Google Wikipedia Google Scholar New York Times Library Catalog Seems like a lot of advice articles for marketing professionals Mostly about the company, Ctrl + F for \"algorithm\" doesn't turn up much Several results from a publication ACM (something to look into) and conference presentations &gt; that tells me this is a new topic and people haven't yet turned their conference presentations into published journal articles Lots of commentary on TikTok and its issues for individuals, the tech world, and international events More specific scholarly articles from particular fields. One for business or plastic surgery (?) <ol> <li> <p>Do a deep dive By now you should have a sense of some of the main issues related to your topic. Pick one and dig in! You're still not committing to it for good, but you want the experience of finding more scholarship and identifying the people who are writing in this field. You might want to set a timer for 15 minutes and see where you end up. Follow links, citations, and references to other people. For example: I found this article in the library catalog on TikTok and public health. One of the authors was Marco Zenone so I Googled him and found his personal website. He's a Canadian PhD student with a nice beard and a snazzy website. His Twitter account provides many links to similar stories about technology and public health, maybe one is more interesting or relevant to my topic? There's a lot on the potential harm of Amazon review, we haven't really talked about that, but it could be a good potential data source.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rinse and repeat When your timer is up you can decide whether you want to keep going or start down a new rabbit hole following this similar process of following links and scholars. For this assignment, share your notes on investigating at least two sub-topics. You should end up with enough sources for the Annotated Bibliography assignment, due the same day. Think of that assignment as the more formal presentation of the work you conducted in this activity. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Specs: </p> <ul> <li>This assignment can be done as a Word/Google doc or by hand on paper. It can be messy! I want you to document what you're doing, not worrying that you're getting the \"right\" answer. </li> <li>No word count, but be thorough!
