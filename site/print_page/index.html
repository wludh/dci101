<p>There are many reasons you might want your own website. Whether it's for work, school, volunteering, organizing, art, or just for fun, there are plenty of ways to carve out your own corner of the Web. Social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook are ubiquitous now, but it used to be that if you wanted to appear in search results, you had to create your own website. If you are a student or navigating the professional world, chances are that 1) someone out there might Google you and 2) you want them to see accurate information and work that you're proud of. A professional website can be a simple single page with limited information, or it can contain your whole life. Chances are, at some point you've relied on information from a personal website. Maybe you found an article you need for a bibliography, a snippet of code that had been giving you trouble, or even an email address for someone who has lost their wallet.</p>
<p>If you're conducting research in a field, making art, or selling products, there are others who will be interested in the work you're doing. Check out the sites of others in your intended field of study or career path to see what their websites look like. Some scholars share articles they've written, code libraries, data they've gathered, or new methods they're experimenting with. In the library and digital scholarship world, open and public scholarship is highly valued. Many of the links in this website go to the websites of DH-ers who have been generous enough to share a tutorial or write up their thoughts on a particular method.</p>
<p>Whether you create a professional portfolio or not, there is a lot to be said for the form of a website. Most of the scholarship we read, not to mention everything else, has been designed and formatted to be consumed on the Web. Presenting your own work in that format gives you experience with seemingly silly things like getting your images to float nicely with your text or finding a place to reliably store your data. Creating a clean, well-organized website is harder than it looks! Just like it's easier to read a paragraph than to write one, creating a website takes practice.</p>
<h2 id="domain-privacy">Privacy<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-privacy" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>All that being said, you do not have to have a strong presence on the Web. You may have personal and legitimate reasons for not wanting to be found in search results. If you're a student, you may not want your homework following you for decades to come. You have the right to privacy and to completing your coursework in a secure way. While you are required to use your domain for this class, you can make it private during the course or remove it after the class is over. The domain provided for you in this class will be de-activated following your graduation, unless you choose to take over ownership.</p>
<h2 id="domain-reclaim-hosting">Reclaim Hosting<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-reclaim-hosting" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are many places to find space on the Web, but many individuals and academic institutions work with <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, an education-focused web hosting company. Reclaim offers reasonable rates, good support, and an awareness of the needs of academic projects. Some institutions offer a "domain of one's" program in which affiliated individuals can obtain a domain.</p>
<h2 id="domain-wordpress">WordPress<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-wordpress" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Whether you knew it or not, chances are you have visited many, many WordPress websites. WordPress is an open-source content management system used by 42% of the web (as claimed by WordPress). Though it's thought of as a blogging platform, it powers plenty of major websites. We'll use WordPress in this class as a platform for blog posts and your final project. It is easy to install on your domain and has plenty of customization options. It's likely that you might need to use WordPress at a future job, internship, or volunteer venture, so it's a good skill to have. Because of its popularity, there are many resources online for learning or troubleshooting WordPress. </p>

<li>Change the password to something you can remember or store. There's not automatic way to reset your password like there is with other services. W&amp;L provides <a href="https://my.wlu.edu/its/how-to/keeper">Keeper</a> as a password manager. Highly recommend using one! </li>

<li>You should see a Wordpress icon near the top of the page. Click on it to begin installing Wordpress.</li>
<li>Find the "install this application" button.</li>
<li>Work through the installation. You can leave the default settings except for the following:<ul>
<li>Directory - since you might want to use this domain for other things, let's put course materials in a subdirectory, such as <code>http://www.mydomain.info/dci101</code>.</li>

<li>Customize the website title and tagline.</li>

<li>Set up your menu by going to <code>Appearance &gt; Menus</code>. You will need to create a menu, add pages to it, and select a location for that menu. This is usually the most confusing part of Wordpress! There should be a video tutorial in our Box folder.</li>
<li>Before you start adding content to your site, play around with as many of the settings and features as possible. What do all the bells and whistles do? Add your own images or colors. This is your site!</li>

<p>It's obviously within your rights to decide you don't want your homework available to the public. However, I still want you to gain experience working in a content management system and website environment. To password protect your pages/pages, look for the <code>Visibility</code> section when you publish your post. Select <code>password protected</code> to add a password. <strong>But don't forget to share that password with me when you submit on Canvas!</strong> In the past, some students choose a basic password that they use for ever post. </p>

<p>I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at: https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations</p>
<p>If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two weeks of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam.</p>

<p>You may notice that I do not factor participation into your grade. This is on purpose. I design my classes so that you can't <em>not</em> participate. Class sessions are structured to help you advance your learning, not just for you to receive content. If you're not in the room, you will miss a lot of learning that can't be made up by the reading.</p>
<h2 id="policies-plagiarism">Plagiarism<a class="headerlink" href="#policies-plagiarism" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation.

<h2 id="policies-use-of-artificial-intelligence">Use of Artificial Intelligence<a class="headerlink" href="#policies-use-of-artificial-intelligence" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Generative AI tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—are widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for text and DALL•E and Midjourney for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our term together.
You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Please cite the tool according to the guidelines for citing computer software, as outlined by your chosen style guide (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc). Additionally, please include a brief description of how you used the tool.</li>
<li>If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out-of-date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations.</li>
<li>Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility — not the tool’s — to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. Misuse or unauthorized usage of generative AI tools may constitute an Honor Violation, which can be further expounded in the White Book. Please communicate with me if there is any confusion regarding its usage for assignments, assessments, or any other coursework.</li>

<li>If you have ever labeled yourself as “bad at technology,” you are welcome in this course. There is no assumed technical skill. </li>
<li>"Technology" is a lot of things. Chances are you will know something about it that your classmates do not. Be generous about teaching and learning from each other. See also: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">https://xkcd.com/1053/</a></li>
<li>Your laptop will be a major player in this course, even more than usual. Please make sure it is good working order by updating software (operating system, browers, etc) and visiting the IT help desk as necessary. </li>
<li>That being said, using your laptop in class is not an invitation to distraction. Look up how to disable notifications since you will have to share your screen in class.</li>
<li>This course will mix theory and hands-on work. Be prepared to think critically about technology AND to get your hands dirty in a little bit of code.</li>
<li>The DCI community experimentation and productive failure, often in public. We will learn from how and why things don’t work. We are not just going to talk about what we’re learning but how we’re learning it. Give yourself a break from perfectionism!</li>

<h2 id="protocols-land-acknowledgment">Land Acknowledgment<a class="headerlink" href="#protocols-land-acknowledgment" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Just because this course is about digital stuff does not mean we're exempt from thinking about land. The Internet is very much a physical thing, full of fibers and networks and cables connecting computers to one another. It's a utility, just like electricity or water or natural gas, and it must traverse many miles to be accessible to each individual. Remember our <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/">submarine cable map</a> and or the <a href="https://www.infrapedia.com/app">US map of cables</a>? We still need to consider the question - whose land? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The land we are on was but a small portion of land inhabited by people who called themselves Yesa (yeh-saw, which means the people). These Eastern Siouan Speaking people inhabited the land in the interior portion of Virginia from the New River to the Fall Lines at Richmond for well over a thousand years before the arrival of the Europeans.</p>
<p>Through years of warfare, disease, forced migration, and broken treaties, the original people were reduced to a fraction of their original numbers living on a small portion of their original land. They were forced into assimilation by the dominant culture.</p>
<p>The descendants of these original inhabitants are still here today. We know them as the Monacan and they understand the land is the people and the people is the land and are not strangers on any of the land that was once considered their territory. As we are able to have air to breathe and water to drink remember the original people have been stewards of the land for centuries and have made it possible for us to enjoy many of the natural resources we still have today.We honor the Monacan and their ancestors. </p>

<li>Part 2: What does David Weinberger say about the DIKW hierarchy? How has "the digital" changed the nature of these concepts? Work in your group to come up with a new model/visual/illustration for the DIKW hierarchy that accounts for Weinberger's arguments.

<p>At the beginning of this course, I asked you your earliest memory of the internet. For this activity, let's turn that question around. What is the internet's earliest memory of you? Think back to Ian Mulligan's story about Warhammer in the 1990s or the personal essays by Tolentino or Chayka.</p>
<p>Write a short biography of yourself using only information that can be found online about you, preferably in public with no logging in. Use Google and the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to search for yourself and anything in your past life on the web. What can you find? What <em>can't</em> you find? What is surprising? What has been erased? </p>
<p>After you've dug around and composed the bio, let's hear a little about the process. What was easy to find? Difficult? How has your web presence changed over time? What were you taught about using the internet with respect to privacy and how have your thoughts changed over time? How much of the content was on social media vs. another site (your school, team, etc)? If a researcher from the future is trying to learn about you, what are they missing out on? </p>
<p><strong>Specifications:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a WordPress page, then turn in the URL in Canvas. If you feel more comfortable keeping this page private, that's fine, just include the password when you submit.</li>
<li>50-100 word bio. 300-400 words on process. </li>
<li>Include links and images as you're comfortable. If you do not want to link to an old webpage (for privacy, embarrassment, etc), consider a small screenshot. </li>

<p>Using the information we learned this week about how the internet works, what can you figure out about where <em>your</em> internet comes from? Without encroaching on any closet or area of campus you shouldn't, what can you discern through observation or sleuthing about the network that provides you with limitless wifi? Start in your dorm room or classroom, but pay attention as you walk through campus. Where does the wifi drop out? Can you the spot the routers or wireless extenders? Where do you think the wires are hidden? Are there overlooked spaces on campus that suddenly seem important to this story? Can you find the data center(s) on campus? What happens if a fiber is cut or an internet service provider goes down? How does the geographic location of W&amp;L affect your internet access? If you have relevant information from your internet access at home, you're welcome to share it. You may also have to do some internet sleuthing to find these answers. I recommend searching "rana broadband." How does W&amp;L play a role in providing internet access to the wider area?</p>
<p>This post should be a narration of the technological landscape of campus, along with 2-3 pictures to illustrate your findings. You should plan to walk around <strong>and</strong> do some internet sleuthing.</p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.</li>
<li>300-500 words.</li>
<li>Free from grammatical errors, typos. </li>

<li>Include 2-3 images of the sites of Internet presence that you notice on campus. </li>
<li>Even if you can't find answers, I want to hear about your process. </li>

<p>Time to create your own Geocities-style website! Using the HTML and CSS skills you've learned this week, construct a small website about yourself, your interests, your fandoms, your pets - whatever you want! You'll upload this website to your domain like we did on class on Thursday.</p>
<p>Check out this page on <a href="https://yournamehere.scholarslab.org/individuality-solidarity/">Individuality and Solidarity</a> from the <em>Your Name Here</em> project if you need some inspiration to get you thinking out of traditional boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create minimum of 2 HTML pages and 1 CSS document. </li>
<li>Upload to a subdirectory of your domain, then turn in the link on Canvas. If my domain was <code>https://brooksm.wludci.info</code> and I uploaded my files to a folder called <code>newsite</code> then I would turn in the URL <code>https://brooksm.wludci.info/newsite</code>. </li>
<li>Try to create this site in the style of the Geocities website we looked at last week. Put aside your savvy digital native mindset and imagine you're brand new to the internet and what has to offer. This is up to your own interpretation, but I want to see some engagement with the vibes of early web history. </li>
<li>Include the following:<ul>
<li>images (at least one on each page) with alt text</li>
<li>table</li>
<li>links to a second page and external site (open in a new tab)</li>
<li>background color</li>
<li>list (ordered or unordered)</li>

<li>Activity: let's audit an algorithm. Each team will be assigned a platform (Netflix, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).<ol>
<li>Create a Boxnote in our <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/folder/286189691421">folder</a> for your team. </li>
<li>Work together to answer the following: <ul>
<li>Who created this platform? Who owns it? Are those the same thing?</li>
<li>What is the goal of this platform?</li>
<li>Where does the money come from? </li>
<li>Where does the content come from? Are creators paid?  Do they own their creations? How do you know?</li>
<li>Give me a brief idea of the user experience. What happens on this platform? How does your experience of the platform differ from your classmates'? </li>
<li>Where do you suspect algorithms are working? How do you know? What are they doing? Let's employ Cathy O'Neil's audit:<ul>
<li>data integrity - can we trust the data being used?</li>
<li>what is this platform's definition of success?</li>
<li>accuracy - are there errors? how often? for whom does this model fail? what is the cost of failure?</li>

<p>Let’s start brainstorming about potential project topics. What are you interested in? What’s compelling about your major/minor? How do DCI concepts fit into that topic? If you don't have a major/minor yet, could this be a way to explore a topic related to a potential area of interest? Maybe you want to dive into something you haven't had a chance to explore in college yet. Think broadly! </p>
<p>Next, what questions do you have about that topic? Take a look at the <a href="#assignments-digital-essay">final project description</a> to get a sense of what you'll be doing with the digital essay. </p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.</li>
<li>300-500 words.</li>
<li>Include 3-5 questions you have either about the final project or about your topic. </li>
<li>Free from grammatical errors, typos. </li>
<li>Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! </li>

<p>We've read a lot about the dangers of algorithms and AI and how they "automate the status quo" (Davidson). But what about AI for good? I don't want you to leave this class being entirely pessimistic about technology. How can these technologies improve the world? For this activity, I want you to invent an app or website that will do its best to be free of bias or harm. What sector would you create this app in? How would you ensure it passes the algorithm audit? Your chosen topic can be in response to the article you found for Thursday, or it can be something new.</p>

<p>Your activity log this week will document your work on your annotated bibliography. The following is designed to help you get started on finding sources. You should write your answers as you go - they can be messy! </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Brainstorm keywords.</strong> Think about your topic. What are all the potential words that describe or relate to this topic? Start from your own brain first, then go to a search engine. You could even draw a mind map of the way terms relate or how different disciplines/industries refer to the same concept. The deeper you get into a field, the more you find that experts use specialized language to get more specific about what they're talking about. <em>For example: as I start searching for information about algorithms, I start to see references to "neural networks" and "deep learning" algorithms. I'll add those to my list and look for definitions.</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish a baseline.</strong> Look for your topic in several search engines or database and get a sense of the initial results. I would suggest Google, Google Scholar, Wikipedia, the <a href="http://library.wlu.edu/">Library Catalog</a>, and a news source (New York Times, Washington Post, etc.) What do you see in the top ten results? What are the issues being discussed? What types of sources are coming up (blog posts, news articles, etc)? Who are the authors? Consider searching in a private browser as well, just to see if the results are different. Make a table or a list for each search engine and summarize the results. <em>For example: TikTok algorithm</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Google</th>
<th>Wikipedia</th>
<th>Google Scholar</th>
<th>New York Times</th>
<th>Library Catalog</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Seems like a lot of advice articles for marketing professionals</td>
<td>Mostly about the company, Ctrl + F for "algorithm" doesn't turn up much</td>
<td>Several results from a publication ACM (something to look into) and conference presentations &gt; that tells me this is a new topic and people haven't yet turned their conference presentations into published journal articles</td>
<td>Lots of commentary on TikTok and its issues for individuals, the tech world, and international events</td>
<td>More specific scholarly articles from particular fields. One for business or plastic surgery (?)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Do a deep dive</strong> By now you should have a sense of some of the main issues related to your topic. Pick one and dig in! You're still not committing to it for good, but you want the experience of finding more scholarship and identifying the people who are writing in this field. You might want to set a timer for 15 minutes and see where you end up. Follow links, citations, and references to other people. <em>For example: I found this article in the library catalog on TikTok and public health. One of the authors was Marco Zenone so I Googled him and found his <a href="https://www.marcozenone.ca/">personal website</a>. He's a Canadian PhD student with a nice beard and a snazzy website. His Twitter account provides many links to similar stories about technology and public health, maybe one is more interesting or relevant to my topic? There's a lot on the potential harm of Amazon review, we haven't really talked about that, but it could be a good potential data source.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rinse and repeat</strong> When your timer is up you can decide whether you want to keep going or start down a new rabbit hole following this similar process of following links and scholars. For this assignment, share your notes on investigating at least two sub-topics. You should end up with enough sources for the Annotated Bibliography assignment, due the same day. Think of that assignment as the more formal presentation of the work you conducted in this activity. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This assignment can be done as a Word/Google doc or by hand on paper. It can be messy! I want you to document what you're doing, not worrying that you're getting the "right" answer. </li>
<li>No word count, but be thorough! Show your work, as they say in math class.</li>
<li>Free from grammatical errors, typos. </li>
<li>Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! </li>

<p>Activity 4.1 - let's make some data! </p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/file/1667743907209">Alumni Coeducation Correspondence, May 10, 1984 (report)</a> from the <a href="https://digitalarchive.wlu.edu/">W&amp;L Digital Archive</a>. Take some time to read through the report, making note of the content and how it is presented. How are the first few pages different than the rest?</li>
<li>Create your data model (a list of the fields you want to include and how to express those values) in a Box note for your group in <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/folder/288135496687">this folder</a>. Look over all the types of information included in the report. Choose what fields you think you should include. Why are you choosing those fields? How would these fields be useful in exploring/visualizing the data? Will your data collection enable certain research questions? Is there anything you can leave out?</li>
<li>Once your model is set up, go ahead and start transcribing the data. Each team will be assigned a few pages to transcribe into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jbP4je-Z1j-j8l9JL9i_-weOIVi6X3GUqVw32cdas7M/edit?usp=sharing">this Google spreadsheet</a>. Try to avoid looking at other team's sheets. We want to be able to compare the differences at the end of this activity.</li>
<li>After we come back from the small groups, compare your data model to that of other groups and answer the following questions.<ul>
<li>How are the models different?</li>
<li>What did your group include that others didn't and vice versa?</li>
<li>How do your fields change the questions you can ask the data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Activity 4.2</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's practice making some visualizations with this data. Here's a more complete dataset: <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/file/1667760246410">Coeducation data</a>. </li>
<li>First, let's make a hand-drawn data visualization the paper/pen provided. </li>
<li>Then we can move into making it in Excel or Google Sheets if there's time. If not, we'll cover next week!</li>
<li>Here are some instructions in <strong>Excel</strong>: <ul>
<li>First, we need to make a <strong>PivotTable</strong>. This creates a version of the data that be more easily summarized for the charts. </li>
<li>Select all the columns in your spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Go to <code>Insert</code> then select <code>PivotTable</code>. </li>
<li>Complete the wizard. You'll want to <code>add to new worksheet</code>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let's make a basic bar graph that shows the breakdown of support for coeducation. <ul>
<li>First, add the <code>PivotChart</code> box to your sheet. It's in the middle of the Insert menu.</li>
<li>In the pane on the right called <code>PivotChart Fields</code>, select <code>opinion</code>. You should a count of all the opinions in a single bar. Sure okay, but not quite what we want. </li>
<li>Drag the <code>opinion</code> field to the <code>Axis (Categories)</code> window. Now we see each category broken out on the X axis. Ta da! </li>
<li>Can you figure out how to make this a pie chart? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What about a stacked bar graph that shows both the opinion and who they wrote to? Try it first before reading the instructions.<ul>
<li>Select the stacked column chart type. </li>
<li>Add <code>opinion</code> to the <code>Values</code> box.</li>
<li>Add <code>opinion</code> to the <code>Axis (Categories)</code> box.</li>
<li>Add <code>addressee of letter</code> to the <code>Legend (Series)</code> box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <strong>Google Sheets</strong>:<ul>
<li>Select the column(s) you want to visualize. </li>
<li>From the menu, go to Insert &gt; Chart. A window pops up and makes suggestions for you. Spend some time with these options!</li>

<p>Let's make sure you can think critically about data and data visualizations that are designed to persuade. This blog post focuses on the audience and argument of data and data visualizations. Go out into the wilds of the internet and find a data visualization that speaks to you. It doesn't have to be on the topic of your future project, but this might be a nice way to get started on research. Answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this visualization trying to convey? Is it successful? Does it convince you? Why or why not? Would the piece work without the visualization?</li>
<li>Does the style suit the data? How so? What other visualization styles would work?</li>
<li>Who made this visualization? What is their background?</li>
<li>Who is the audience and what is the context (publication, website, etc.)?</li>
<li>What is source of the data of this visualization? Can you find the original data set? Try hard! Where did you look? What format is it in?</li>
<li>How might this data be subject to the biases of its authors? Where are the binaries or hierarchies? </li>
<li>What else could be done with this data set? Other research questions? Other visualizations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> </p>

<p>This week we went through the process of creating a data set from scratch, determining some research questions, then creating data visualizations. We also read a chapter about "What Gets Counted Counts" and the ways that bias can affect the results of any data-driven projects. For this activity, I'm going to hand you a new data set and it's your job to make sense of it. What can you determine about its creation? What are some of its issues? What research questions might it inspire? Can you create a basic data visualization? What silences or gaps are in this data set? Spend some time just browsing around before you dive into answering the questions. </p>

<li>Who created this data set? </li>
<li>What does this data contain? Provide a narrative summary and the data model (list of the fields and the data type).</li>
<li>What are some issues with this data? What inconsistencies do you notice? Why might these be an issue? </li>
<li>What research questions does this data set prompt? How might different disciplines approach this data differently? Give an example or twos.</li>
<li>What further research might you need to do to make sense of this data? What websites or sources would be useful? Give an example. </li>
<li>Create 1-2 data visualizations using this data set. You should definitely only use a small subset of the data. You almost certainly will have to clean up the data a little bit (give Open Refine a whirl). You can use Excel or any of the other platforms we talked about in class OR you can draw them by hand. The point is not to master the visualization software, but to start thinking in terms of what a visualization should express. Embed these visualizations on the page.</li>

<p>Let's apply some of the design principles we discussed this week in class to your own site. First, take a look at your site as an outside observer. What are the functional/sensory/cognitive affordances? What can your site do and what might you need to change to make it work better or look better or be more accessible? </p>
<p>You may have to Google or watch a video to figure out how to change features. That is okay and encouraged! Part of this class is learning how to figure out new technology without detailed instructions. What happens when you press the help button? </p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Spend 30-60 minutes improving the design and functionality of your WordPress site. </li>
<li>Add alt text image descriptions for all your images. </li>
<li>Write some custom CSS using the CSS skills we learned early in the term. See Activity 6.4 below for some advice and direction. </li>
<li>Turn in your site URL on Canvas when you're done. Summarize your changes in a comment. </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Activity 6.4 - Code meet WordPess. Beyond the options provided to you in WordPress, how can you change your website using the HTML/CSS we learned earlier in class? <ul>
<li>In the admin screen for your WordPress site, navigate to Appearance &gt; Customize. </li>
<li>Check out all these settings and see what you might want to change! Your content should be safe. </li>
<li>Visit the <code>Additional CSS</code> screen. Remember our CSS from a few weeks ago? Write some here to change the style of your site. </li>
<li>You might need to use the Inspect tool in your browser to figure out how to target the HTML element or CSS class you're trying to change. For example, I'm always annoyed at seeing the "Powered by WordPress" line on my site. By inspecting the page, I can see that that piece of text is in a <code>&lt;div class="powered-by"&gt;</code> So I can write the following to hide it:
        <code>.powered-by {
        display:none;
    }</code> </li>

<p>Let's brainstorm some research questions before we embark on these tech challenges today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text analysis methods and tools </p>
<ul>
<li>Activity 6.2 - How to build your corpus<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wludh/dataset-RingtumPhi">Ring-tum Phi dataset</a> </li>
<li>Browse the RTP in the <a href="https://digitalarchive.wlu.edu/islandora/ring-tum-phi">Digital Archive</a></li>

</li>
<li>Activity 6.3 - a quick diversion into the command line <ul>
<li>On your computer, search for a program called <code>terminal</code> or <code>cmd.exe</code> (Windows).</li>
<li>Type <code>pwd</code> then hit enter. What do you see? </li>
<li>Type <code>ls</code> then hit enter. What files/folder do you see? </li>
<li>Type <code>cd Desktop</code> then <code>pwd</code>. Did you make it to your Desktop?</li>
<li>Use <code>cd [foldername]</code> and <code>cd ..</code> to navigate through your file structure to get to the RTP folder.</li>
<li>Navigate into a folder full of text files. Type <code>ls</code>. What if you wanted to combine all of them into one file? Try <code>cat *.txt &gt; newfile.txt</code> - what happens? </li>

<li>Address the following:<ul>
<li>Who created this project? What is their institutional home and who made up their team? (No need to list every name, just summarize the types of people involved). </li>
<li>What is the corpus? What is the source of the data? Is it something you can access and download yourself?</li>
<li>What are their research questions? Can you find them easily? If not, what can you surmise are the questions? Think back to the Argument Clinic article from this week. Can you see a hypothesis? Their testing? Their contextualization? </li>
<li>What type of text analysis is being done? Are they counting words, doing topic modeling, or sentiment analysis? How do you know? </li>
<li>How do you feel about the design of the website? What are its affordances? Are the data visualizations well-done? </li>

<p>Now that you're comfortable with Voyant, let's return to the <a href="https://github.com/wludh/dataset-ringtumPhi">Ring-tum Phi</a> and compare it to another corpus: the <a href="https://github.com/wludh/dataset-AlumniMagazine">Alumni Magazine</a>. Select similar portions of time from both the Ring-tum Phi and the Alumni Magazine. You probably don't want to start with the entire decade - it's often best to start with a small bit of data and move up from there.</p>
<p>Assemble your corpus. Now that you're familiar with Voyant, what makes the most sense for each file? How many years should go in each file aka what is the "granularity?" How do you need to structure the corpus to balance the granularity of each file? IE: if one text file contains an entire year and another file contains just one month, how will that affect your graph?</p>
<p>Upload your corpus to Voyant. To add a multiple files, find the Documents tab in the lower left corner. Press the Modify button, then Add, then Upload, to add more text files to Voyant. Make sure your files are named in a way so that they will be easy to distinguish from one another.</p>
<p>Try out the various visualizations in Voyant. Which work best for a comparison between these two corpora? What can you learn about how these two publications cover the same topics? </p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.</li>
<li>Embed 3 visualizations (either images or iframes). Your visualizations should be comparing the RTP to the Alumni magazine. Don't forget to title/caption them! </li>
<li>Write 300-400 words that addresses the following:<ul>
<li>Which visualization styles work best for a comparison between these two corpora?</li>
<li>What can you learn about how these two publications cover the same topics?</li>
<li>What potential research questions could you form based on this corpus? </li>
<li>How might you use text analysis methods in your own project?</li>

<li>Project chat. Before we start, let's do a little free writing. Take out a piece of paper and address the following: <ul>
<li>How am I feeling about my project?</li>
<li>What research do I need to do before writing my proposal?</li>
<li>What analysis and visualization methods am I interested in? (data viz, mapping, text analysis, etc)</li>
<li>What questions do I have for Prof. Brooks?</li>
<li>What are my immediate next steps?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activity 9.1: To start thinking spatially, let's create a map from scratch.<ul>
<li>Gather some blank paper and your favorite writing/drawing/coloring instruments.</li>
<li>Without consulting any existing maps, draw a map of campus.</li>
<li>In a small group, we'll compare our maps with each other. How are your maps similar or different? What choices did you make? How are your choices informed by your hobbies, extra-curriculars, personality, abilities, etc? What was challenging? What makes our campus hard/easy to map?</li>
<li>Now, let's look at the existing <a href="http://campusmap.wlu.edu">campus map</a> as well as <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/file/1060929370759">images from the firm</a> redesigning some of our spaces on campus. How did they approach our campus? What did they privilege or ignore? Does this depiction of space match your own perceptions?</li>
<li>Finally, let's try out making a data-driven map of campus. How would you go about doing that? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activity 9.2: Let's continue building on our <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/file/1667760246410">Coeducation Report data set</a> so we can use it to try out some mapping tools in the next activity. Our data set needs coordinates, not just location names, for it to be easily to process by the mapping tools. Before I tell you exactly how to add coordinates, spend some time on Google. What services are out there for converting location names to coordinates? How do they work? What formats do they accept or produce? Remember, while it might be possible to convert each location one at a time, this would not be practical if our data set was any bigger. Let's look for some more automated solutions. <em>Treat this as homework for Thursday if we don't finish on Tuesday.</em></li>

<li>Use the paintbrush icon to style the pins by a certain field.</li>
<li>What else can you do? What can't you do? Does this answer our research question?</li>
</ul>

<li>Activity 8.5: Mapping tools! There are a lot of options for tools that will create maps. In this activity, we'll divide into groups and test out a platform or two. We'll use the Coeducation Report as the data source for our map.<ul>
<li>Platforms:<ul>
<li><a href="http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/">Palladio</a> - you might need a <a href="http://hdlab.stanford.edu/doc/scenario-simple-map.pdf">tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html">ArcGIS Online</a> - Note that you can create a <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/oauth2/signup?client_id=arcgisonline&amp;redirect_uri=http://www.arcgis.com&amp;response_type=token">free public account</a> or use the <a href="https://storymaps.com/">StoryMaps</a> feature. We have an institutional license if you want to use ArcGIS longer term.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/maps">DataWrapper</a> (tutorial <a href="https://handsondataviz.org/symbolmap-datawrapper.html">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover">Tableau Public</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your groups, answer the following questions. Record your answers in a <a href="https://wlu.app.box.com/folder/291427710663">Boxnote in this folder</a> so that other students can consult the information.<ul>
<li>Who created this tool? Is it open source? Is it free?</li>
<li>How do I use it? Browser or download? OS preference?</li>
<li>How do I add data? What formats does it accept?</li>
<li>How do I add layers?</li>
<li>How do I add shapes or pins?</li>
<li>Can I add a historical map? How?</li>
<li>Where is the basemap from? (Google, OpenStreetMap, etc.) Can I change it?</li>
<li>What type of mapping project would suit this tool?</li>
<li>Can you find the documentation? Other tutorials?</li>
<li>Using the Coeducation Report data, create a map. You may need to alter the data to fit the requirements of the mapping tool.</li>

<h3 id="schedule-week08-blog-post-8">Blog post #8<a class="headerlink" href="#schedule-week08-blog-post-8" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>There are a lot of ways to use maps in research and scholarship! For this blog post, select a project from <a href="https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/spatial-spatiotemporal-analysis">this list of spatial projects</a> from the site <a href="https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/review-process">Reviews in Digital Humanities</a>. Try to pick that has a web map, not just a timeline. In your write-up, try to concentrate on the ways the author uses the map to answer research questions (or fails to). Another angle: how does the map enable you to answer your own research questions? </p>
<p><strong>Finally, and this is important:</strong> try to avoid reading the review of the project until after you've looked at it yourself. Write your notes, then come back to the full review. What did they include that you overlooked? What did you notice that the review didn't touch on? </p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.</li>
<li>300-500 words. </li>
<li>Free from grammatical errors, typos. </li>
<li>Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! </li>
<li>Address the following:<ul>
<li>Who created this project? What is their institutional home and who made up their team? (No need to list every name, just summarize the types of people involved). </li>
<li>What is the map? Is it modern or historical? What is the source of the data? Is it something you can access and download yourself?</li>
<li>What are their research questions? Can you find them easily? If not, what can you surmise are the questions? </li>
<li>What type of spatial analysis is being done? What does the map enable you to do to? </li>
<li>What software is being used to present the map? How can you tell? </li>
<li>How do you feel about the design of the website? What are its affordances? Are the data visualizations well-done? </li>
<li>Finally, compare and contrast your review to the one in Reviews in DH. Where did you overlap or differ? </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

In 150-300 words, answer the same questions from our in-class activity, then provide additional commentary on the differences between this platform and the one you looked at in class. How do the affordances differ? Use the Coeducation Report data set to create a map, then embed it into your post. </p>

<p>Revision makes a difference! Our conversation in our meeting and further research by you as homework should produce a stronger proposal and a clear roadmap for your project. Your proposal revision should address the things we talked about in our meeting, as well as lay out the work ahead of you. You should know what data you're going to use and link to it or if you're making it yourself, your sources. Your bibliography should be updated with the new sources you're finding (annotations not necessary). You should describe the form your project website will take and what you hope to achieve. Do you want it be one long scroll-y page or broken into multiple pages with a menu? </p>
<h3 id="schedule-week09-blog-post-9">Blog post #9<a class="headerlink" href="#schedule-week09-blog-post-9" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Revision is important! In this post, you'll briefly summarize my feedback on Canvas and in our discussion at our individual meeting, then describe what you did with that feedback. How did your thinking change? What did you modify about your project? What further steps do you need to take? What are your very specific next steps?  </p>

<p>Let's build on the work we did in class to identify and collect current websites for posterity and future research. In class you decided on important topics as a collective. For this activity log, I want you to pick out 3-5 sites on a single topic that matters to you personally. You don't have to worry about whether they're of historical significance - these are sites that you want to be part of the cultural record. </p>

<li>Identify 3-5 websites and save the links in the Internet Archive. </li>
<li>List the captured link and write a few sentences on 1) why this site matters (to you) and 2) any challenges to capturing this site. Are there ethical issues? Technical ones? For instance, is it password protected? Subject to an algorithm? Is the content too dynamic to capture easily? Does the site consent to being saved? </li>

<p>Each week you’ll write a 300-500 word blog post on your website in response to a prompt. Prompts will invite you to dig deeper into readings, discussion topics, or your own experiences. These posts aren't meant to be busy work, rather they're a chance for you to practice thinking critically and analyzing information. They help me know what you're thinking and <em>how</em> you're thinking. Plus, I know that talking a lot in class isn't for everyone. Think of these posts as an extension of your participation. You don't have to know all the answers, just be thoughtful in your questions! </p>
<p><strong>General specifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a WordPress post, then turn in the URL in Canvas. </li>
<li>300-500 words.</li>
<li>Free from grammatical errors, typos. </li>
<li>Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignments-activity-log">Activity log<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-activity-log" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Each week we’ll learn a new skill together in class. The activity log will document the ways you practice and build that skill on your own. Logs will be submitted on your website or as a document in Canvas. </p>
<p>Specifications will be specific to each activity. </p>
<h2 id="assignments-digital-essay">Digital essay<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-digital-essay" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Your big project for this course is the composition of a question-driven digital essay on a topic related to digital culture and information. The digital essay will combine text (2000-3000 words), data visualization, multimedia, and web design. Work on this project will be distributed throughout the course through research, exploratory data visualization, a proposal, process updates, and a final presentation. The subject of your digital essay is up to you provided it is related to digital culture and information and is approved by the instructor. Essays will be posted to your website. </p>
<p>Why an essay? While this might feel like a familiar format to you from high school etc, I'd invite you to put aside what you know about the form. Essay comes from the French <em>to try</em> and that's where you should start your thinking for this assignment. That doesn't mean your standards should be low, but you should think about this assignment as an <em>attempt</em> to do something new. How do you write about digital culture? How do you study it? How do you analyze it? We spend so much of our time on these platforms, but it can be hard to pin down exactly what they're doing. It's hard to analyze something when you don't know how it works! This course is an exploration of the methods for studying digital culture and this assignment should engage at least one of those methods, recognizing that they are new to you and new to other scholars. And recognizing that we have a short time frame to construct these essays!  </p>

<h3 id="assignments-annotated-bibliography">Annotated Bibliography<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-annotated-bibliography" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>You are not doing this work in a vacuum! It's important to have a sense of the existing scholarship and research in whatever area you're writing about. We might not have a class in it at W&amp;L, but that does not mean that there's not a scholar out there doing similar work. Knowing where to look and how to look is an essential research skill that will benefit you in college and beyond. We'll have at least one session in class dedicated to finding resources. The sources you find for this assignment will be incorporated into your literature review in your final project.</p>
<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due October 8 at 12pm. </li>
<li>Published to your website, submitted on Canvas. </li>
<li>6-10 sources. 3 must be scholarly sources (books, journal articles, or peer reviewed web sources). </li>
<li>Each source should be formatted in an established citation style of your choosing. Use <a href="http://library.wlu.edu/zotero">Zotero</a> if it helps! </li>
<li>Annotations should be at least two sentences. In the first sentence, summarize the source. In the second sentence, say something about why this source is useful for your project. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assignments-exploratory-data-visualization">Exploratory Data Visualization<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-exploratory-data-visualization" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>This isn't a Data Science class, but that doesn't mean we can't use the tools of data visualization to learn more about our topic. For this assignment, you'll need to find data, hypothesize about it, and then observe any patterns you find. Per usual, this isn't about finding the right answers but exploring the data available and what it can <em>actually</em> tell you.</p>
<p>Don't overcomplicate this! Your visualizations can, and probably should, be simple. You're not trying to prove a grand theory with this data, you're letting the data speak for itself. You do not have to figure out advanced statistics either, unless you have training in that already, rather rely on basic counts and categorical data, just like we did in class. </p>
<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due October 22 at 12pm.</li>
<li>Published to your website, submitted on Canvas.</li>
<li>Include 3 data visualizations from 1 or more data sets. <ul>
<li>You can use Excel, Google Sheets, or something like <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> or <a href="https://www.rawgraphs.io/">Raw Graphs</a>. </li>
<li>Visualizations should have appropriate labels, a title, citation, and a caption. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include 1 paragraph about your data sources, how you found them, whether they are good/reliable sources. </li>
<li>Include 1 paragraph about your hypotheses and potential research questions. This can be bullets. </li>
<li>Include 1 paragraph about the results. What did you visualizations tell you? What patterns did you observe? Were there outliers in the data that warrant further investigation? What other data sources do you want to find OR what data sources do you wish existed? </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assignments-proposal">Proposal<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-proposal" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Time to commit! What is your digital essay going to be about? What questions are you interested in asking? What methods are you hoping to use? What drew you to this topic? Your final project proposal should be more formal in style. </p>
<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft due November 5. Final version due November 12th. </li>
<li>Published your website, submitted on Canvas.</li>
<li>300-500 words. </li>
<li>Address the following: <ul>
<li>What is the topic of your project? What led you to this topic?</li>
<li>What are some potential research questions (at least two)? What discipline are you situating yourself in?</li>
<li>What is your proposed method of analysis? (Think text analysis, data viz, mapping, etc). What is your source of data? Tell me about it!</li>
<li>What research have you done on your topic? Cite at least 2-3 scholarly sources and any less-than-scholarly sources that are relevant. These can be from your annotated bib, but they should be relevant to the question/topic you've landed on.</li>
<li>What will success look like for you? Is there a skill you want to develop? Do you want to advance your knowledge on a particular method or topic?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include a proposed schedule and list of tasks to complete your project. You should also include a rough outline of the sections of your project and a few sentences on the design of your project. How will you take advantage of the digital medium to display this essay in a creative way? </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assignments-digital-essay_1">Digital Essay<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-digital-essay_1" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due December 6th at noon.</li>
<li>Published to the web on your domain. You can choose one of the following:<ul>
<li>A section of your course WordPress site.</li>
<li>A new WordPress installation dedicated to your essay.</li>
<li>A subdomain built with hand-coded HTML/CSS or a framework like Bootstrap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2000-3000 words in the main body of the essay. </li>
<li>Your essay should <em>attempt</em> to answer the research questions outlined in your proposal. It's pretty impractical that you're going to end up with THE answer less than 12 weeks. Remember that "essay" means "to try" in French. How can your further the conversation around your topic? What patterns do you notice? What concerns you? Can you apply an existing framework on a new case study? </li>
<li>Use at least one of the methods we learned this term (data viz, text analysis, web scraping, mapping). How you incorporate these methods is going to depend a lot on your topic and your questions. You should plan to include at least three visualizations. </li>
<li>A clearly defined structure to your essay that takes advantage of the digital medium. Don't just copy and paste a Word doc! Use headings or separate pages. In general, you want sections like: introduction, lit review, methods, results, bibliography. But you're free to be creative with how they come together! </li>
<li>Similarly, the design of the website should complement your content. The affordances of your WordPress theme should be in line with the goals of the essay. It should be clear that you made design choices beyond what comes out of the box. This could be color, imagery, hand-coded elements, embedded media, etc. </li>
<li>You can re-use content from previous assignments (like your proposal), but you should revise any text based on feedback and to ensure it flows with the entire essay.  </li>
</ul></section><section class="print-page" id="grading"><h1 id="grading-specs-grading">Specs Grading</h1><h2 id="specifications-grading">Specifications Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-specifications-grading" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The assignment and grading structure for this course might be a little different than what you're used to. In this course, we'll use something called <em>Specifications Grading</em>. The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and digital methods we will be learning this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. It is more important to me that you explore and experiment with these methods than it is that you get the "right answer." It's hard to feel comfortable experimenting and making mistakes if you're worried about every little point. </p>
<p>So rather than assign points or grades, I will mark each assignment as Complete/Incomplete according to a set of specifications. </p>
<p>You must complete a certain number of assignments in each category to receive the corresponding grade, as seen in the table below. This means that your grade is always going up as you complete more assignments. It also means that you must complete the requisite number of assignments in each category to get the grade. </p>
<p>You will use Canvas to turn in assignments and to receive feedback. I will mark your assignments as complete/incomplete, however! Canvas will not be able to calculate your current grade with this system.     </p>
<p>This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester. We will do a midterm check-in so you have a good understanding of where you are. </p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more, here's a <a href="https://teaching.unl.edu/resources/grading-feedback/specifications-grading/">resource from UN-Lincoln</a>.</p>
<h3 id="grading-tokens">Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-tokens" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>You're not expected to be perfect at every assignment! To help you recover from any incomplete assignments, you will be assigned <strong>three tokens</strong>. Using a token will give you <em>one week</em> to revise and resubmit an assignment to receive credit. To use a token, you must submit an entry in Canvas declaring which assignment you're revising. Then you must re-submit your revised work for the appropriate assignment in Canvas. I'll award a point in Canvas for each token you use, but these points are not factored into your final grade. Using a token does not guarantee that you will receive a complete on the re-submission, but hopefully with my feedback you can get there. </p>

<h3 id="grading-attendance-policy">Attendance Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-attendance-policy" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>I get it, life happens. If you need to miss class, please email me in advance (before noon on class day if possible). It helps me plan our activities if I know how many students will be attending and keeps me from worrying that you've fallen in the river. </p>
<p>That being said, the way I've designed this course means that if you're not in the room, you will miss a lot of learning that can't be made up by the reading. Once you have more than <strong>2 absences</strong>, it will affect your grade. Every subsequent absence will decrease your letter grade by one step (B to B-, B- to C+, etc.)</p>
<p>And while I want you to succeed in the next stage of your career, please try to avoid scheduling meetings, interviews, or extra-curriculars during class time. Missing more than 45 minutes of class will constitute a full absence. </p></section><h1 class='nav-section-title-end'>Ended: Assignments</h1></div>
