## Accommodations

I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at: https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations

If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two weeks of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam.

## Participation

You may notice that I do not factor participation into your grade. This is on purpose. I design my classes so that you can't *not* participate. Class sessions are structured to help you advance your learning, not just for you to receive content. If you're not in the room, you will miss a lot of learning that can't be made up by the reading.


## Plagiarism

All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence 

Generative AI tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—are widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for text and DALL•E and Midjourney for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our term together.
You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools.

* If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Please cite the tool according to the guidelines for citing computer software, as outlined by your chosen style guide (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc). Additionally, please include a brief description of how you used the tool.
* If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out-of-date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations.
* Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content.
* It is your responsibility — not the tool’s — to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. Misuse or unauthorized usage of generative AI tools may constitute an Honor Violation, which can be further expounded in the White Book. Please communicate with me if there is any confusion regarding its usage for assignments, assessments, or any other coursework.
