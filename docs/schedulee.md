## Week 1 - What is DCI?

*In our first week, let's unpack what we even mean by digital culture and information. How do we define something that we are surrounded by every day? How do we talk about it? Study it? Analyze it? Critique it?*

### Week 1 Assignments

**Due by Tuesday at 12pm**

#### Blog post #1

What brought you to this class? How do you relate to digital culture and information in your personal life? Academic life? What do you find most interesting? Concerning? What personal goals do you have for this class - skills you want to develop or topics you want to explore? What will success look like *for you*, beyond just an A? 

**Specifications:**

* Create a WordPress post, then turn in the URL in Canvas. 
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

#### Activity log #1 - the internet's earliest memory of you

At the beginning of this course, I asked you your earliest memory of the internet. For this activity, let's turn that question around. What is the internet's earliest memory of you? Write a short biography of yourself using information that can be found online about you, preferably in public with no logging in. Use Google and the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to search for youself and anything in your web history. What can you find? What *can't* you find? What is surprising? What has been erased? 

After you've dug around and composed the bio, let's hear a little about the process. What was easy to find? Difficult? How has your web presence changed over time? What were you taught about using the internet with respect to privacy and how have your thoughts changed over time? How much of the content was on social media vs. another site (your school, team, etc)? If a researcher from the future is trying to learn about you, what are they missing out on? 

**Specifications:** 

* Create a WordPress page, then turn in the URL in Canvas. If you feel more comfortable keeping this page private, that's fine, just include the password when you submit.
* 50-100 word bio. 250-500 words on process. 
* Include links and images as you're comfortable. If you do not want to link to an old webpage, consider a screenshot.

### Week 2 Assignments - Due Tuesday by 12pm


#### Blog post #2 - Where does your Internet come from?

Using the information we learned this week about how the Internet works, what can you figure out about where *your* internet comes from? Without encroaching on any closet or area of campus you shouldn't, what can you discern through observation about the network that provides you with limitless wifi? Start in your dorm room or classroom, but pay attention as you walk through campus. Where does the wifi drop out? Can you the spot the routers? Where do you think the wires are hidden? Are there overlooked spaces on campus that suddenly seem important to this story? Bonus: can you find the data center on campus? 

This post should be a narration of the technological landscape of campus, along with 3-5 pictures to illustrate your findings. 

**Specs:**

* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 
* Include 3-5 images of the sites of Internet presence that you notice on campus. 


#### Activity log #2

Time to create your own Geocities-style website! Using the HTML and CSS skills you've learned this week, construct a small website about yourself, your interests, your fandoms, your pets - whatever you want! You'll upload this website to your domain. Check out this page on [Individuality and Solidarity](https://yournamehere.scholarslab.org/individuality-solidarity/) from the *Your Name Here* project if you need some inspiration to get you thinking out of traditional boxes.

**Specs:**

* Create minimum of 2 HTML pages and 1 CSS document. 
* Upload to a subdirectory of your domain, then turn in the link on Canvas. If my domain was `https://brooksm.wludci.info` and I uploaded my files to a folder called `newsite` then I would turn in the URL `https://brooksm.wludci.info/newsite`. 
* Include the following:
	* images (at least one on each page)
	* table
	* links to a second page and external site (open in a new tab)
	* background color
	* style your links
	* use divs, add padding/margin to move content around on your pages

# Week 3 - The algorithm made me do it

*They're seemingly everywhere, influencing all your decisions. What to buy, who to date, what to watch, who to hire? Algorithm is a common enough word these days, but do we know what they are? What they do? Can we blame everything on the algorithm? What about AI or machine learning? Oh and what about ethics?*

* Activity: reverse engineer an algorithm. Each team will be assigned a platform (Netflix, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).
	1. Create a Boxnote in our folder for your team. 
	2. Work together to answer the following: 
		* Who created this platform? Who owns it? Are those the same thing?
		* Where does the money come from? 
		* Where does the content come from? Are creators paid? Do they own their creations? 
		* Give me a brief idea of the user experience. What happens on this platform? 
		* Where do you suspect algorithms are working? How do you know? What are they doing? 
		* How does your experience of the platform differ from your classmates'? 
		* Where do the problems lie? Where could bias enter? 
		* Suggest some alterations to the way this platform functions.

### Week 3 Assignments - Due Tuesday at 12pm

#### Blog post #3 
Letâ€™s start brainstorming about potential project topics. What are you interested in? Whatâ€™s compelling about your major/minor? How do DCI concepts fit into that topic? If you don't have a major/minor yet, could this be a way to explore a topic related to a potential area of interest? Maybe you want to dive into something you haven't had a chance to explore in college yet. Think broadly! 

Next, what questions do you have about that topic? Take a look at the final project description to get a sense of what you'll be doing with the digital essay. 

**Specs:** 

* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!

*Sure big data is nice, but have you ever tried handcrafted artisanal data? This week weâ€™ll learn how data is made by creating it from scratch.*

* icebreaker:

* Activity 4.1 - let's make some data! 
	* Start with the [Alumni Coeducation Correspondence, May 10, 1984 (report)](https://dspace.wlu.edu/handle/11021/34413) from the [W&L Digital Archive](https://dspace.wlu.edu/). Take some time to read through the report, making note of the content and how it is presented. How are the first few pages different than the rest?
    * Create your data model in a Box note for your group in this folder. Look over all the types of information included in the report. Choose what fields you think you should include. Why are you choosing those fields? How would these fields be useful in exploring/visualizing the data? Will your data collection enable certain research questions? Is there anything you can leave out?
    * Once your model is set up, go ahead and start transcribing the data. Each team will be assigned a few pages to transcribe into this Google spreadsheet. Try to avoid looking at other team's sheets. We want to be able to compare the differences at the end of this activity.
	* After we come back from the small groups, compare your data model to that of other groups and answer the following questions.
        * How are the models different?
        * What did your group include that others didn't and visa versa?
        * How do your fields change the questions you can ask the data?
        * How could you use Open Refine to clean up the data you created?
