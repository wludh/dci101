### Week 11 Assignments - Due Tuesday after break at 12pm


#### Blog post #11 
In preparation to present your project in class, draft a 5 minute talk. You have an option when turning this in! It can be a blog post or an audio or video file that you turn in via Canvas. It can be hard to say everything you want to say in 5 minutes! Try to address the following:

* What is your project about? What are your research questions?
* Why did you select this topic?
* Where is the data from? What challenges did you face finding data or doing research on this topic?
* What did you learn about your topic? How did the analysis methods help? What did you learn about digital culture and information as it relates to your topic?
* What would you do differently OR what are the future directions of this project?


**Specs:** 

* Due Tuesday at 12pm.
* Can be a WordPress post, or an audio/video file submitted directly on Canvas.
* Should be the equivalent of 5 minutes of speaking.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!
