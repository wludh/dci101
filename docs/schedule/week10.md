# Week 10 – Project work
*Class this week will be a mix of structured activities and unstructured work time to advance your project’s progress.*

## Tuesday, November 12
* icebreaker: 
* Project planning: take 5 minutes to brain dump your questions, thoughts, feelings, plans about your project. What are you going to get done this week? What do you need help with? What questions do you have for me? 
* Groups: 
	* Fran, Clifton 
	* Cece, Sydney
	* Graham, Sahil
	* Hadley, Greg 
	* Abbie, Evan

* Share + find data: In your groups, share your project topic and research questions with each other. Scholarship and research does not have to be a solitary act! Do you have advice for your classmate on where to find data and what to do with it? 

**Due for Thursday:**

Create 1-3 data visualizations for peer review! 

## Thursday, November 14

* icebreaker: 
* data viz peer review 
* Groups:
	* Antonio, Fran
	* Evan, Sydney
	* Cece, Graham 
	* Harris, Ha
	* Hadley, Clifton
	* Abbie, Greg

* Peer review process:
	* You will need to remove the password from your pages/posts or share it with your classmates.
	* Think of 1-2 questions you have for your peer reviewer.
	* Before discussing, take time to read their proposal and carefully study their visualizations.
	* Your discussion should address the following:
		* What is the goal of this visualization? Is it achieving its goal? WHY? or why not?
		* What isn't working? Thinking back to the principles we learned about data visualization or the analysis methods (in the case of maps, text, etc.) and apply them here. For instance: Does the visualization need a legend? Would the map benefit from a different base map?
		* What ideas/suggestions do you have for improvement or for other directions/data sources/visualization tools?
		* How can you help answer the questions of the project creator?
		* Take a few notes - you will be asked to report on this in your blog posts this week.


## Week 10 Assignments - Due Tuesday at 12pm

### Probably a good idea to keep working on your project!!

### Blog post #10 - Project update

As we near the end of term, the last few blog posts will be project updates to help you and me keep track of where you're at with your project. It's easy to procrastinate or get sucked into one part of the project and lose track of making progress. A weekly project update gives you a moment to pause and assess where you're at and what else you need to do. 

Answer the following: what did you get done this week? How did it go? What could have gone better? What lessons did you learn this week? What did you learn that will be useful outside this class? What did you learn from your peer reviewers? What are your goals for next week? 

**Specs:** 

* Due Tuesday at 12pm.
* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 150-300 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!
