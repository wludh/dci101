# Week 12 â€“ Project presentations
*Let's share!* 

## Tuesday, December 3

* [Course evaluation](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Igao0Zmp5UOOtnhzkF6Tnn3cY98vc8BFrlWfJe-zBiFUQ0JRMjFDMzU3VEI0UDJTU0dXTjUwUzZLSS4u&route=shorturl)
* Let's do our final presentations in a poster presentation style! Rather than presenting to the whole class, one after another, we'll spread out into multiple rooms and rotate through. You will present from your website, no slides necessary. You should still prepare a bit of an elevator pitch (guiding questions below) but otherwise be ready to answer questions from your classmates.

## Blog Post 12 is due Friday 12/13 at 11:59pm.

In 200-300 words, reflect on the presentations of your classmates. What was impressive? What was unexpected? What was inspiring? As you think about all the projects together, what can you say about digital culture and information? 

**Specs:**

* Create a post on WordPress, turn it in on Canvas.
* 200-300 words.


## Your final reflection is due 12/13 by 5pm. 

No project is complete without time taken to reflect on its successes and lessons learned. Talk about your feelings! What have you learned about digital culture and information? What have you learned about yourself and the way you learn new things? 

**Specs:**

* Due Friday, December 13 by 5pm.
* Submit as a document in Canvas.
* 500-1000 words.
* Address the following. Your answers should be about the course as a whole, not just your project topic.
	* What have you learned? Which of these things is most important to you? What did you learn about the material that you didn't expect? What did you learn about yourself?
    * What has been challenging? Why?
   	* Think back to the start of class and blog post #1. How has your relationship with technology changed? What about your conception of digital culture and information? Have you met your own goals for this course?
    * Revisit the [objectives](https://mackenziekbrooks.github.io/dci101-f24/#course-objectives) for this course. Did we address those objectives? How so?
    * If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?
    * How can you apply the things you learned in this course to future courses or non-academic endeavors?
